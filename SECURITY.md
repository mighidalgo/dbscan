# Security Policy

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

We take the security of our project seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a responsible manner.  Publicly disclosing a vulnerability can put our users at risk, so please give us a chance to address it first.

**Please do not open a public issue on GitHub for security vulnerabilities.**  Instead, follow one of the methods below:

### Preferred Method: Private Issue

1.  Go to the "Issues" tab of this repository.
2.  Click "New issue".
3.  Choose the "Security Vulnerability Report" template (If you don't have a template, just create a regular issue).
4.  Describe the vulnerability in detail, including:
    *   The affected version(s) of the project.
    *   A clear and concise description of the vulnerability.
    *   Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
    *   Any potential impact of the vulnerability.
5.  **Crucially:** Ensure the issue is marked as **private**. This is essential for responsible disclosure.

**Important:** If you choose email, please include the same details mentioned in the "Private Issue" section above.

## What Constitutes a Vulnerability?

Any issue that could potentially compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of our project or its users' data should be considered a security vulnerability.  This includes but is not limited to:

*   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
*   SQL Injection
*   Remote Code Execution (RCE)
*   Authentication Bypass
*   Authorization Issues
*   Denial of Service (DoS)
*   Information Disclosure

## Response Process

We will acknowledge your vulnerability report within 3 business days and will make every effort to address the issue promptly.  We will keep you updated on our progress.

## Responsible Disclosure

We believe in responsible disclosure and appreciate your cooperation in following these guidelines.  We will not take legal action against individuals who report security vulnerabilities in good faith. We may publicly acknowledge your contribution if you wish, after the vulnerability has been resolved.

## Out-of-Scope

The following are considered out of scope for this security policy:

*   Vulnerabilities in third-party libraries or dependencies (unless they directly affect our project).  Please report these to the respective maintainers.
*   Theoretical vulnerabilities that have no practical impact.
*   Issues related to outdated software or configurations that are not under our control.

Thank you for helping us keep our project secure!
